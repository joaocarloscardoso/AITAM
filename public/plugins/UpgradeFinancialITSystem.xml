Sometimes those cause failure of the upgrade, which goals cannot be reached just because resources were spent on additional activities.

Check out if the risk analysis was performed and treated in pragmatic or rather purely formal way. Be sure, was it a part of the broader risk analysis (e.g. encompassing whole organisation, IT, procurement), or a standalone analysis related to the coming upgrade. Was it performed by a team of experts experienced in upgrades? Where risks escalated to appropriate levels of management?

Apart from typical risks referred to IT systems upgrades, were specific conditions taken into account: why the organisation needs the upgrade, is it urgent or important, what if this particular upgrade was postponed or not implemented at all? 

Organisation’s managements tend to treat upgrades as purely technical operations. Problems with low profile of the whole operation, insufficient resourcing and unclear accountability can steam from this point."/>

Pay special attention if the plans have the adequate scope, realistic timetable of the upgrade phases, which should contain controls to assess the progress and security. Was possibility of the upgrade’s fail foreseen? Would the recovery of the system and Business Continuity be possible then?
Necessary resources and responsibilities should be clearly stated. Were both the IT team and core activity team (e.g. Finance or HR) involved in the upgrade planning? Were all interested parties informed about the planned upgrade?
Technical documentation of the system will be usually changed after the upgrade and the administration team will often have to deal with new parameters or function. Their training should be planned then in a proper time.

The user documentation should be modified if necessary and the Help Desk function should be included in the upgrade operation planning. Was the Help Desk team planned to be trained, and then able to deal with post-upgrade issues if signalled by users?

Review the following audit matrices:

-	Outsourcing  Solicitation
-	Vendor or Contractor Monitoring
-	Overseas Service Provider 
-	Retaining Business Knowledge/ Ownership of business process
-	Cost control and management
-	Back-up and disaster recovery for outsourced services

It is difficult to imagine a complex system to be upgraded without any external help. The preparations to the upgrade are then a good test for the real strategies the audited organisation applies to IT investment and outsourcing. It can sometimes happen, that an IT system, which was successfully purchased and installed several years earlier, now does not appear to have a sufficiently developed market of experts.

Contract with the upgrade provider should meet all needed requirements, including warranties and indemnities and rules to identify responsibility for potential incidents and problems occurring as a result of the upgrade.

On the other hand, the external experts should find in the organisation strong enough in-house experts team to make the organisation profiting from the cooperation. 

Consequences can be financial (e.g. related to vendor dependence) or operational – if the upgrade is conducted with insufficient expertise."/>

Compare the two sets of data – if necessary with help of CAATs. If some discrepancies occurred – they should have be documented directly after the upgrade execution and their causes should have been explained by the upgrade provider. A list of all discrepancies and plan of corrections should be prepared by the provider and approved by the key client (e.g. in case of the Accounting system the Organisation’s main Accountant).

The incidents which emerged in relation to the upgrade should have been registered and solved or if their scale is larger, classified as problems and escalated to the change management process.

The list of problems should be discussed with the upgrade provider, who should prepare solutions agenda. The key client should accept this approach. In case of lack of agreement in this regard, legal steps should be taken by the Organisation to receive compensation.

If the upgrade was unsuccessful, were the data restored and functions of the system restarted? In case of the most serious problems the Business Continuity may be at risk. The organisation’s approach to the BCP/DRP, like policies, structures, trainings may then have vital significance. The audit matrices on Organisation of Business Continuity Function, Security may be helpful.."/>

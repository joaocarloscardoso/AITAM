Obtain functional description for each class of input and design information on transaction data entry. Inspect the functionality and design for the presence of timely and complete checks and error messages. If possible, observe transaction data entry.
Assess whether validation criteria and parameters on input data match business rules and enforce rejection of unmatched input types. In case of online processing systems, verify that invalid data is rejected or edited on entry and test the logic checks/calculation checks performed. Database operatives (such as *, =, or, select) should be disallowed as valid input, as they can be used to disrupt or retrieve information from the database.
Inquire managers about whether validation criteria and parameters on input data are periodically reviewed, confirmed and updated in a timely, appropriate and authorized manner. Assurance could be obtained through documentation review, code analysis or interviews.
Inquire and check documentation in order to verify the possibility of overriding input data control validations and controls. Verify if the override actions are being properly logged and reviewed for appropriateness. Check whether authority to override is restricted to only supervisory staff and to a limited number of situations. Inspect error corrections, entry overrides and other documents to verify that the procedures are followed.

Determine which interfaces exist with the application. These interfaces could be in the form of real-time data transmission or periodic transmission of data files via batch processes. Review system flow diagrams and system code, and interview the application developers or administrator to obtain information on interfaces and controls over them. Eg: Control totals from interface transmissions (eg. Hash totals - totals that have no inherent meaning, such as summing all account numbers or employee numbers in a file being transmitted, record counts, and total amounts) should be generated and used by  the system to determine whether the transmission completed accurately.

.
Analyze business rules, requirements, application documentation and inquire business process owners to determine which validation rules should be assured in the business process being assessed. Check if these validation rules were proper designed and documented. Verify whether the validation controls for data input are being enforced: observing application users into real action; running the application in a testing environment and testing different interfaces for data entry; analyzing data records stored in the database through the use of CAATs.
Obtain functional description for each class of input and design information on transaction data entry. Inspect the functionality and design for the presence of timely and complete checks and error messages. If possible, observe transaction data entry.
Assess whether validation criteria and parameters on input data match business rules and enforce rejection of unmatched input types. In case of online processing systems, verify that invalid data is rejected or edited on entry and test the logic checks/calculation checks performed. Database operatives (such as *, =, or, select) should be disallowed as valid input, as they can be used to disrupt or retrieve information from the database.
Inquire managers about whether validation criteria and parameters on input data are periodically reviewed, confirmed and updated in a timely, appropriate and authorized manner. Assurance could be obtained through documentation review, code analysis or interviews.
Inquire and check documentation in order to verify the possibility of overriding input data control validations and controls. Verify if the override actions are being properly logged and reviewed for appropriateness. Check whether authority to override is restricted to only supervisory staff and to a limited number of situations. Inspect error corrections, entry overrides and other documents to verify that the procedures are followed.

Determine which interfaces exist with the application. These interfaces could be in the form of real-time data transmission or periodic transmission of data files via batch processes. Review system flow diagrams and system code, and interview the application developers or administrator to obtain information on interfaces and controls over them. Eg: Control totals from interface transmissions (eg. Hash totals - totals that have no inherent meaning, such as summing all account numbers or employee numbers in a file being transmitted, record counts, and total amounts) should be generated and used by  the system to determine whether the transmission completed accurately.
.
Inspect and observe creation and documentation of data preparation procedures, and inquire whether and confirm that procedures are understood and the correct source media are used.

Assess whether the Data Processing group (DP) or equivalent group maintains a log of all the user departments’ source documents received and their final disposal. Verify the existence of a system of reconciliation of record counts with user department groups.

Verify that all source documents include standard components, contain proper documentation (e.g., timeliness, predetermined input codes, default values) and are authorized by management.

Inspect whether critical source documents are pre-numbered and how out-of-sequence numbers are identified and taken into account. Identify and review out-of-sequence numbers, gaps and duplicates using automated tools (CAATs). Verify if there is assignment of unique and sequential numbers to each transaction preventing duplication.

Enquire responsible personnel about retention policies. Verify how these policies are ensured. A sample of system records might be checked against its source documents..
.
Discuss the application's error and exception handling with the developer or administrator. Inquire whether and confirm that policies and procedures exist for handling transactions that fail edit and validation checks.

Verify whether the system provide error messages for every type of error (field level or transaction level) not meeting the edit validation.

Verify how the application behaves if data is rejected by the input controls. Check whether the data items are recorded or if they are automatically written in a suspense file. Check if the automated suspense file includes codes indicating error types, date and time of entry and identify the person entering data. Evaluate if there are procedures for reviewing and correcting data in the suspense file before processing it again. Assess whether an escalation procedure is in place when error rates are too high and corrective action is taken.

Enquire managers about the existence of procedures for periodically reviewing the log. Verify whether the procedures include the initiation of corrective measures. Obtain evidence either documental or digital that the log is being periodically reviewed.
.
Inquire whether and confirm that the design of the system provides for the use of preapproved authorization lists. Verify, through inspection of authorization lists, that authorization levels are properly defined for each group of transactions. Assess whether authorization rules for data input, editing, acceptance, rejection and override for major classes of transactions are well designed and documented.

Observe that authorization levels are properly applied running the application in a  testing environment. Verify, through the use of CAATs or embedded audit modules, that the authorization records present in the database are compliant to the authorization rules defined.

Determine if a separation of duties (SOD) table exists and review for adequate separation of key duties/ job functions and permitted transactions, then, look into list of users and user-specific access privileges.
Assess whether segregation of duties ensure that the person keying the data is not also responsible for verification of document. Verify the adoption of compensating controls in cases which SOD was not feasible..
.
Identify the executable programs in the application from a study of the data flow chart and match them with defined and established business process rules.

Review the application documentation to verify that it is applicable and suitable for the task. Where appropriate for critical transactions, review the code to confirm that controls in the tools and applications operate as designed. Reprocess a representative sample to verify that automated tools operate as intended.

For highly critical transactions, set up a test system that operates like the live system. Process transactions in the test system to ensure that valid transactions are processed appropriately and in a timely fashion.
.
Analysis Method(s)

Assess whether the application have adequate validity checks in place to ensure processing integrity. Inspect the functionality and design for the presence of sequence and duplication errors, referential integrity checks, control, and hash totals

Inspect reconciliations and other documents to verify whether input counts are coherent with output counts to ensure completeness of data processing. Trace transactions through the process to verify that reconciliations effectively determine whether file totals match or the out-of-balance condition is reported. Inquire whether control files are used to record transaction counts and monetary values, and that the values are compared after posting.

Verify that reports are generated identifying out-of-balance conditions and that the reports are reviewed, approved and distributed to the appropriate personnel
Take a sample of data input transactions. Use appropriate automated analysis and search tools to identify cases where errors were identified erroneously and cases where errors were not detected

Inquire whether and confirm that utilities are used, where possible, to automatically maintain the integrity of data during unexpected interruptions in data processing. Inspect the audit trail and other documents, plans, policies and procedures to verify that system capabilities are effectively designed to automatically maintain data integrity

Inspect the functional description and design information on transaction data entry to verify whether transactions failing validation routines are posted to suspense files.

Verify that suspense files are correctly and consistently produced and that users are informed of transactions posted to suspense accounts. For a sample of transaction systems, verify that suspense accounts and suspense files for transactions failing validation routines contain only recent errors. Confirm that older failing transactions have been appropriately remediated..

.
Obtain a list of all electronic outputs that are reused in end-user applications. Verify that the electronic output is tested for completeness and accuracy before the output is reused and reprocessed.

Examine the balancing and reconciliation of output as established by documented methods

Select a representative sample of electronic output, and trace selected documents through the process to ensure that completeness and accuracy are verified before other operations are performed.
Re-perform completeness and accuracy tests to validate that they are effective. Examine if each output product contains processing program name or number; title or description; processing period covered; user name and location; date and time prepared; security classification.

Select a representative sample of output reports, and test the reasonableness and accuracy of the output. Verify that potential errors are reported and centrally logged.
.
Review output handling and retention procedures for privacy and security. Assess whether procedures have been defined that require the logging of potential errors and their resolution prior to distribution of the reports. Examine the system of reconciliation of output batch control totals with input batch control totals before release of reports establishing data integrity

Check if there are documented procedures for labeling sensitive application output and, where required, sending sensitive output to special access-controlled output devices. Review the distribution methods of sensitive information and verify that the mechanisms correctly enforce pre-established access rights
.
Obtain documentation and assess the design, implementation, access and review of audit trails. Inspect the audit trail structure and other documents to verify that the audit trail is designed effectively. Inquire who can disable or delete the audit trails

Inspect the audit trail, other documents, plans, policies and procedures to verify that adjustments, overrides and high-value transactions are designed effectively to be promptly reviewed in detail.

Inspect the audit trail, transactions (or batches), reviews and other documents; trace transactions through the process; and, where possible, use automated evidence collection, including sample data, embedded audit modules or CAATS, to verify that periodic review and maintenance of the audit trail effectively detects unusual activity and supervisor reviews are effective.

Inquire how the access to the audit trail is restricted. Examine access rights and access logs to the audit trail files. Verify whether only restrict and authorized personnel have access to the audit trail. Assess if there is the audit trail is protected against privileged modifications.

Verify, where possible, using automated evidence collection, if unique identifiers are being assigned to each transaction

.
Review the available documentation of the software/hardware solution. Interview the auditee's IT team to see how they understand the security mechanisms implemented into the application.
It is of utmost importance to have a clear concept of what should be upgraded, in which scope and at what cost. The concept should be supported by an reliable analysis of needs and possibilities. Weak concept may result in additional yet unnecessary tasks, time and money waste at later phases of the project with. Sometimes those cause failure of the upgrade, which goals cannot be reached just because resources were spent on additional activities.

Effective IT Strategy can reflect general ability of organisations for prioritising goals and provide necessary instruments to reach them. Looking for a methodical support you can use IT Audit Handbook part on IT Governance – IT Strategy and planning and content of matrix on Business Needs Identification, Direction and Monitoring and on IT Strategy.
Use IT Audit Handbook part on IT Governance – Internal Control. Exemplary audit matrix for Risk Assessment and Compliance Mechanisms can be helpful.

Check out if the risk analysis was performed and treated in pragmatic or rather purely formal way. Be sure, was it a part of the broader risk analysis (e.g. encompassing whole organisation, IT, procurement), or a standalone analysis related to the coming upgrade. Was it performed by a team of experts experienced in upgrades? Where risks escalated to appropriate levels of management?

Apart from typical risks referred to IT systems upgrades, were specific conditions taken into account: why the organisation needs the upgrade, is it urgent or important, what if this particular upgrade was postponed or not implemented at all? 

Organisation’s managements tend to treat upgrades as purely technical operations. Problems with low profile of the whole operation, insufficient resourcing and unclear accountability can steam from this point.
If possible, find relation between the upgrade planning and the Organisation’s IT Strategy. Use especially IT Audit Handbook sections:
-	IT Governance – IT Strategy and Planning
-	Development and Acquisition – Requirements Development and Management

You can also find helpful the content of exemplary matrices for: 
-	Business Needs Identification, Direction and Monitoring 
-	IT Strategy
-	Requirements Developmentand Management
-	Business Continuity Policy
-	Business Impact Assessment
-	Disaster Recovery Plan

Pay special attention if the plans have the adequate scope, realistic timetable of the upgrade phases, which should contain controls to assess the progress and security. Was possibility of the upgrade’s fail foreseen? Would the recovery of the system and Business Continuity be possible then?
Necessary resources and responsibilities should be clearly stated. Were both the IT team and core activity team (e.g. Finance or HR) involved in the upgrade planning? Were all interested parties informed about the planned upgrade?
Technical documentation of the system will be usually changed after the upgrade and the administration team will often have to deal with new parameters or function. Their training should be planned then in a proper time.

The user documentation should be modified if necessary and the Help Desk function should be included in the upgrade operation planning. Was the Help Desk team planned to be trained, and then able to deal with post-upgrade issues if signalled by users?
.
Use IT Audit Handbook part on IT Governance – People and resources and the audit matrix on People and Resources.

In case of problems occurring at later stages, check if the staff assigned to the upgrade tasks was sufficient in number, competencies and responsibilities. Was the task fed back as effectively and fair managed?.
Use IT Audit Handbook part on Development and Acquisition Solicitation and all chapter on Outsourcing.

Review the following audit matrices:
-	D&A Solicitation
-	Outsourcing Policy
-	Outsourcing  Solicitation
-	Vendor or Contractor Monitoring
-	Overseas Service Provider 
-	Retaining Business Knowledge/ Ownership of business process
-	Cost control and management
-	Back-up and disaster recovery for outsourced services

It is difficult to imagine a complex system to be upgraded without any external help. The preparations to the upgrade are then a good test for the real strategies the audited organisation applies to IT investment and outsourcing. It can sometimes happen, that an IT system, which was successfully purchased and installed several years earlier, now does not appear to have a sufficiently developed market of experts.

Contract with the upgrade provider should meet all needed requirements, including warranties and indemnities and rules to identify responsibility for potential incidents and problems occurring as a result of the upgrade.

On the other hand, the external experts should find in the organisation strong enough in-house experts team to make the organisation profiting from the cooperation. 

Consequences can be financial (e.g. related to vendor dependence) or operational – if the upgrade is conducted with insufficient expertise.
The documentation should be analysed with special attention to gaps and exceptions. In case of any doubts ,contact the staff and/or external experts who took part in the upgrade operation.

Where the results registered, analysed and compared to the planned parameters? If the results differed from the plans, were any ad hoc corrections executed? Were the issues occurring during the upgrade managed effectively?

In IT Audit Handbook read: IT Operations - Service Level Agreement and Outsourcing – Service Level Agreement.

Review the following exemplary audit matrices:
IT Operations - Service Management,
Outsourcing – Service Level Agreement
.
The content of the both data reports depends on nature of the upgraded system. For instance, if it is accounting system you will need at least a list of accounts with balances for the time before the upgrade started and a second list with the same accounts for the time the upgrade was completed.

Check when the reports were prepared and who prepared them. They should be a part of the Upgrade acceptance documentation. If they are prepared for the audit purposes, be present at the process of retrieving them from the system.

Compare the two sets of data – if necessary with help of CAATs. If some discrepancies occurred – they should have be documented directly after the upgrade execution and their causes should have been explained by the upgrade provider. A list of all discrepancies and plan of corrections should be prepared by the provider and approved by the key client (e.g. in case of the Accounting system the Organisation’s main Accountant).

Use IT Audit Handbook part on Application Controls – Output to assess the traceability (Application Security matrix) of any doubtful records.  IT Audit Handbook on Information Security and related audit matrices can be helpful to review policy, organization, access, environment and other fields that may be relevant in case of the audited upgrade.
Many incidents and problems will usually be noticed after the upgrade operation, when administrators and users perform their tasks with support of the modified system. They can also emerge after the upgrade because some of the functionalities or system parameters changed and the users or administrators were not trained effectively.

Use IT Audit Handbook part on IT Operations – Problem and Incident Management and IT Operations – Change Management. The audit matrices under the same titles can be helpful too.

The incidents which emerged in relation to the upgrade should have been registered and solved or if their scale is larger, classified as problems and escalated to the change management process.

The list of problems should be discussed with the upgrade provider, who should prepare solutions agenda. The key client should accept this approach. In case of lack of agreement in this regard, legal steps should be taken by the Organisation to receive compensation.

If the upgrade was unsuccessful, were the data restored and functions of the system restarted? In case of the most serious problems the Business Continuity may be at risk. The organisation’s approach to the BCP/DRP, like policies, structures, trainings may then have vital significance. The audit matrices on Organisation of Business Continuity Function, Security may be helpful..
The report should be analysed with special attention concerned to its completeness and reliability – especially in case when the data comparison (see above) results in list of discrepancies.

This should be a formal document clearly stating that the key client accepts work done by the provider as a whole or in an unambiguously defined scope. All interested parties should sign the document or provide their opinion in other way. 

Pay special attention to financial part compared to calendar and parameters reached.

The report may be accompanied with internal documents containing list of meaningful lessons learnt, issues to be solved, recommendations and follow-up instructions. For instance, complexity and cost of the operation, interoperability issues, or availability of external experts can influence the Organization IT investment strategy. .

The objective of the audit is to assess whether the SIGTAS information system, with particular emphasis on the debt collection module, supports the goals and strategy of the institution, providing reliable, accurate and complete information. With this audit we aim to provide relevant recommendations to stakeholders in order to improve information flow controls.
The information system has clear validity checks for error handling by communicating problems in order to take corrective action for any type of error. Errors that occur when placing data in the relevant fields can be appropriately corrected prior to processing transactions and can be traced. Error logs should be periodically reviewed and necessary corrective actions should be taken.
Emergency modification procedures are in place to ensure that emergency upgrades can be carried out without compromising system integrity. Changes to the code (in the production environment) must be tested and tracked in the records produced by the system indicating the date and time of the change, as well as in the appropriate authorized documentation.
Validation rules must be designed, documented, and implemented  in the information system data entry.
There are divisions and levels of transaction authorization and they are implemented through various controls. In cases where it is impossible to allocate responsibilities, compensatory controls are in place to reduce opportunities for unauthorized modification or misuse of information or services. .
IT tasks and responsibilities for employees, contractors and third party users are defined and documented in accordance with the organization's information security policy. Policies and procedures should form a sustainable managerial environment for internal and external communications.
Access rights to the use of information systems for all employees, contractors or third parties are terminated at the time of termination of the contract, or are adapted to changes in responsibilities.
Information security policies should cover all operational risks and are reasonably capable of protecting all critical information assets against loss, damage and abuse. Information security policy should be reviewed at scheduled intervals (at least annually) or when significant changes occur in the organization, its business operations or the inherent security-related risk to ensure its continued compliance.
The organization should have policies and procedures for managing change in information systems. Best practices in change control include: Request for change - authentication - acceptance - prioritization - design change - change testing - implementation - documentation. Requests for changes must be approved and documented. The potential impacts of the changes need to be assessed. Requests for change must be reviewed and approved by management. Changes in the management procedure should prioritize changes based on system sensitivity and be considered for adaptability.
Personnel, from recruitment to termination of employment, must maintain Information Security. To maintain a secure environment, the organization must continuously monitor the information technology infrastructure and users of information technology systems.
The information system must meet the criteria set for password management. Administrator account password should only be known by one individual. TAK should be able to use the system in an emergency situation when the administrator is unavailable. To enable access to the system, administrator passwords are kept in a sealed envelope, kept in a locked cabinet, and available to senior managers only. The policy and password must be read and policy recognition must be mandatory by system users. Common system accounts such as Administrator, Admin, Guest should be renamed or deactivated when technically possible.
Information technology administrator and operator account activities are regularly recorded and monitored. There are mechanisms for controlling the activities of users with full access to systems, and for users who are accessed externally and monitored on a continuous basis. The organization conducts a periodic review of user accounts including a review of users' access rights to ensure that they remain appropriate for their function.
The organization should have a plan for the continuity of information systems, which enable continuation of critical services in the event oof a disruption of activities.  This plan should include duties and responsibilities, purpose, resource allocation criteria / principles, recovery procedure, training requirements, maintenance schedule, testing schedule, data retention plans, and approval levels.
The organization should establish the criticality of applications and functions for impact assessment on the Information System, the specified periodicity of data backup and recovery, as well as documented data storage and recovery plans.
Entry control procedures should ensure that every transaction to be processed is entered, processed, and fully and accurately recorded. These controls should ensure that only valid and authorized information is input and these transactions are processed only once.
TAK should have procedures to ensure that the completeness and accuracy of application results is evaluated and can be further processed or processed according to predefined criteria. Taxpayer data must be harmonized across all systems used for tax administration. Reports should be accurate and ensure accurate representation of the data source.
There are controls when processing data to ensure that authorized data remains unchanged.
There are divisions and levels of transaction authorization and they are implemented through various controls. In cases where it is impossible to allocate responsibilities, compensatory controls are in place to reduce opportunities for unauthorized modification or misuse of information or services.
Controls exist and function to ensure that audit traces are generated and maintained for all transaction data. Event reports must be accurate for all activities performed by system users. Access to audit trail records should be limited and controlled, and integrity of audit trail data should be assured against modification.
